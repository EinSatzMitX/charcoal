# Charcoal

My own image viewer for the terminal, written in rust using ratatui and other
crates.

## Why this name?

Charcoal is a pixel-art renderer for your terminal, which uses **char**acters.
The **coal** is because charcoal is supposed to power other programs or plugins
in the future (e.g. a sprite viewer plugin for nvim).
